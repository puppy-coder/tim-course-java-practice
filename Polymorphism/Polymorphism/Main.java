            The code called the method watchMovie() using a Movie reference variable.
            But at runtime, the Movie wasn't really a Movie, it was an instance of the
            subclass, the Adventure class. And it was the method watchMovie() that's
            actually depend on the Adventure class, that really got executed.

            --This is Polymorphism in action--!!

            Our compiled code, in the main method of the Main class, never knew
            anything about the Adventure class, or any of the subclasses.
            But at runtime, we got an object of type Adventure back from the
            factory method.

            Important Point! -- If we add any other new subclass, other than Adventure,
            Science Fiction and Comedy. Eg: Documentary. We can able to add easily without
            doing any change in Main method class.
